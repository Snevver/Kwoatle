# Quotely

Imagine having a personal collection of inspirational or motivational quotes, always within reach. That's exactly what **Quotely** offers!

### What is the app?

**Quotely** is an app where users can save, organize, and share their favorite quotes with friends. Instead of storing quotes in separate notes or screenshots, you can organize them with labels like “Motivation,” “Love,” or “Life Lessons.”

### How does it work?

-   **Add a quote** – See a nice quote online or hear something inspiring? Add it to **Quotely**, including the author and a label.
-   **Organize quotes** – Use labels/tags to keep your quotes organized, so you can easily find and access them.
-   **Sharing & Interaction** – Add friends and view each other's quotes. Rate quotes with a star system (1–5 stars).
-   **Widget on your phone** – Want a new inspiring quote every day on your home screen? **Quotely** has a widget that shows a random quote from your collection each day.
-   **Share quotes from friends' books** – Easily copy quotes from your friends' books into your own collection.
